# Cell Signaling Project For Omnet++

The aim of this project is to model and simulate the communication channel of 
signaling cells over short distances (also knows as paracrine signaling). This
code is the end result of my Final Project for the Telecommunication 
Engineering degree at Polytechnic University of Catalonia, BCN Telecom.

To use this code the user must have installed the Omnet++ Simulation framework 
and import the code as a new project.
